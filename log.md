# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Start Date, June 18th 2017

### Day 1: June 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day Chaining Axios Promises and getting X-CSRF errors. It sucked. Problem still not resolved.

**Thoughts:** I thought this was was more of an obvious set up since Laravel 5 but I guess I was wrong. Tomorrow I'll keep at it and try not to rage.

**Link to work:** [Laravel App, with React Front End](https://github.com/boylecreations/RESTLaravel)

### Day 2: June 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress** Not much. I'm still having Cors issues, but I think i'm getting closer.

**Thoughts** This had better be worth it. I wish there was a more user friendly description on how to do it all.
