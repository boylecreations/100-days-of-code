# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Start Date, June 18th 2017

### Day 1: June 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day Chaining Axios Promises and getting X-CSRF errors. It sucked. Problem still not resolved.

**Thoughts:** I thought this was was more of an obvious set up since Laravel 5 but I guess I was wrong. Tomorrow I'll keep at it and try not to rage.

### Day 2: June 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress** Not much. I'm still having Cors issues, but I think i'm getting closer.

**Thoughts** This had better be worth it. I wish there was a more user friendly description on how to do it all.

### Day 3: June 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress** Well I still can't get the X-CSRF Token to Authorize. Being stubborn and not switching to JSONP for at least one more day.

**Thoughts** No Luck, however I did pull data from other API's easy while realizing that that the WP Nonce might be interfering.

### Day 4: June 21th, 2017

**Today's Progress** Broke down and tried JSONP. Also didn't work. For the sake of making progress in other areas, I'm moving this to the same server so I will be converting the project to custom MVC objects for resources.
**Thoughts** Done this before. Doing it again shouldn't be a problem. On the plus side I understand Middleware a lot more now so I can do some extra tricks.
